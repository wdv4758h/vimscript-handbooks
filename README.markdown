Vimscript handbooks
===================

in _Pandoc_-markdown format.

At the moment there are three handbooks, one for every folder:

d.conway
:	Dr. Damian Conway   
	_Scripting the Vim editor_   
	6 May 2009 - 3 March 2010   

s.losh
:	Steve Losh   
	_Learn Vimscript the hard way_   
	4 April 2013   

b.moolenaar
:   Bram Moolenaar  
    _usr_41_  
    20 February 2013  


How to use it
=============

To compile the documents in TeX or directly PDF use the bash scripts
that came into the same directories.

You need [_Pandoc_](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) by John
MacFarlane. `ajt.latex` is a template for _Pandoc_ that optimizes
the compilation.

Vim Preface
===========

About Vim
---------

Vim is a computer program used for writing which provides a range
of features to help you **write better**.

Why Vim?
--------

Let’s face it, it’s very rare to produce your best work on the first
attempt. Most likely, you will keep editing it frequently until it
becomes ‘good’.

As Louis Brandeis once said:

> “There is no great writing, only great rewriting.”

Making these numerous rapid changes would be a lot easier if we had a
capable editor to help us, and that is _exactly_ where Vim shines, and
is far better compared to most plain text editors and rich document
editors.

Why Write This Book?
--------------------

I have been using the Vim editor ever since I learned to use the old vi
editor during Unix classes in college. Vim is one of the few pieces of
software that I use for nearly 10 hours a day. I knew there were many
features which I didn’t know about that could potentially be useful to
me, so one day I started exploring Vim little by little.

To crystallize my understanding and to help others also explore Vim, I
started writing this collection of notes, and called it a book.

Some of the principles I have tried to keep in mind while writing these
notes are:

1. Simple literature. The importance of this should be reinforced
   again and again.
2. Emphasis on examples and how-to.
3. The one-stop shop for readers to learn Vim – from getting started
   to learning advanced stuff.
4. Get the user to understand how to do things the Vim way – from
   modes to buffers to customization. Most people learn only the basic
   vi commands and do not attempt to learn anything beyond that.
   Learning such concepts is the tipping point, they become hardcore
   Vim users, i.e., Vimmers, which means they extract the most out of
   Vim, which is the intent of this book.
5. A lot of things are documented and stored here as a reference for
   people such as how to use Vim as an IDE, etc. There are various
   ways of doing it and instead of the user struggling to figure out
   which plugins to try out, the book already has the basic background
   work already for the reader.
6. Just enough info to get you to understand and use, not everything
   required (Pareto principle)
7. Relatedly, the book shouldn’t attempt to rewrite the reference
   manual. Where appropriate, it should simply point out the relevant
   parts. This way, there is no redundancy, the user learns to use the
   awesome built-in reference manual which is important, _and_ the
   book can stand on its own strengths as well.

To summarize, the mantra is _Concepts. Examples. Pithy._

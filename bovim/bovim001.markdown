Introduction
------------

“A Byte of Vim” is a book which aims to help you to learn how to use the
Vim editor (version 7), even if all you know is how to use the computer
keyboard.

The first part of this book is meant for new users who want to
understand what Vim is and learn how to use it.

The second part of this book is for people who already know how to use
Vim and want to learn about features that make Vim so powerful, such as
windows and tabs, personal information management, making it a
programmer’s editor, how to extend Vim with your own plugins, and more.

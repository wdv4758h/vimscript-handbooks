Vim en:Typing Skills
====================

Introduction
------------

We just learned about how to switch between the three basic modes
in Vim. Isn’t it hard to remember all those keys? How do you remember
which key is for which operation? Well, that’s the “key” question. The
answer is that you shouldn’t “remember”, _your fingers should
automatically know what to do_! It must (literally) be on your finger
tips.

So how do we do that? By making it a habit. Walking is not a nature that
humans have at birth, but after trying a bit and by habit, we learn to
walk. Same with Vim, although it requires less effort.

Vim was designed for people who are familiar with the keyboard. Why?
Because we spend most of our time in editing tasks, which implicitly
make extensive use of the keyboard, and the faster we are able to type,
the faster we get the work done.

Let’s start with a basic technique to get you comfortable with the
keyboard.

Home Row Technique
------------------

Place your fingers on the home row of the keyboard by positioning
your hands such that the fingers of your left hand are on the `ASDF`
keys and the fingers of your right hand are on the `JKL;` keys as shown
in the drawing (artist unknown).

Getting your hands to be comfortable in this position is one of the most
important steps in learning how to use the keyboard effectively. The
idea is that you should be able to type any key using the finger that is
closest to that key and then your finger should automatically come back
to its original position. It might seem difficult at first but try it a
couple of times and you will see that you will type much faster this
way.

Note that most keyboards have some home row markers on the `F` and `J`
keys which serves as a reminder for you on where your fingers should be
placed.

Now, try typing the alphabets A-Z using the home row technique.

Relatedly, there is also a free online typing tutorial available
that explains the basics of typing skills. I would encourage you to try
it for just ten minutes and explore.

Vim graphical keyboard cheat sheet
----------------------------------

If you want to know how each key can map to something useful in Vim, see
this Vim graphical cheat sheet by ‘jng’.

Although a _lot_ of commands are listed, for now you only need to learn
the basic ‘hjkl’ keys which translates to left, down, up, right keys
respectively. You’ll learn more about this in the next chapter.

Summary
-------

Notice that our efficiency in using Vim is directly proportional to the efficiency of using the keyboard.

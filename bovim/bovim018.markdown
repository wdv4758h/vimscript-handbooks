# Vim en:What Next

##  Introduction

We have explored so much about Vim, so what next?

Well, if you have learned, understood and made Vim _a habit_, then you are officially a Vimmer. Congratulations!

Now, immediately [send me a mail][1] thanking me for this book;-) . This step is optional but recommended.

Also please consider [making a donation][2] to support the continued development of this book, or donate to the Vim project to [help children in Uganda][3].

Next, I recommend to regularly follow the [Vim mailing list][4] to see the kind of queries and answers that appear there. You would be surprised to see the amount of activity and the range of flexibility of Vim that is demonstrated by all the discussion. And you never know, you might be able to answer a few queries too.

Two other important resources that should be good to explore are the [“Best of Vim Tips”][5] page and the all-important [:help user-manual][6] that is an index to everything possible in Vim. Make sure to refer the user-manual from time to time and familiarize yourself on how to find the relevant information so that you can look up for commands as and when required.

Lastly, if you want to know what are the latest cool features in Vim, then see `:help new-7`.

##  Summary

We have gone through a very broad overview of the range of things possible in Vim. The most important thing that we have stressed on again and again is to not learn every feature possible, but to make the features, most useful to you, a habit, and to make sure to use the `:help` to look for features as and when needed.

So, go forth and skyrocket your editing skills to be more efficient and effective than you ever thought possible.

Happy Vimming!
